# MyPlants_python
 This app helps you organise and monitor your house plants

This app enables you to list all of your plants in a very organised way using Python and SQLite.<p>
It allows you to write down the exact name and location of your plant. PH values, humidity and sunlight exposure (these three factors are also shown as a graph) are randomised giving the impression of a sensor, all while having an option to write down notes on each one of them. 
You can create your own username and password, but you can only edit or delete data as an Admin.<p>
USERNAME: Admin<p>
PASSWORD: admin<p>
Thank you for checking it out!
